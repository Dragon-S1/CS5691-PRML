How to run the code 
    1. LSR_1D
        * Currently if you run the LSR_1D.py file it will best fit polynomial for development data
        * To get the Linear regression for test data, change file path for dev data to file path of test data
        * Run the LSR_1D.py file you will get a plot for test data
    2. LSR_1D_err
        * Currently if you run the LSR_1D_err.py file it will show error graph with training and development dataset
        * To get the error plot for test data, change file path for dev data to file path of test data
        * Run the LSR_1D_err.py file you will get error graph with training and test dataset
    3. LSR_2D
        * Currently if you run the LSR_2D.py file it will best fit surface for development data
        * To get the Linear regression for test data, change file path for dev data to file path of test data
        * Run the LSR_2D.py file you will get a plot with best fit surface for test data 
    4. LSR_2D_err
        * Currently if you run the LSR_2D_err.py file it will show error graph with training and development dataset
        * To get the error plot for test data, change file path for dev data to file path of test data
        * Run the LSR_2D_err.py file you will get error graph with training and test dataset
    5. RR_1D
        * Currently if you run the RR_1D.py file it will best fit polynomial for development data
        * To get the Linear regression for test data, change file path for dev data to file path of test data
        * Run the RR_1D.py file you will get a plot for test data
    6. RR_1D_err
        * Currently if you run the RR_1D_err.py file it will show error graph with training and development dataset
